# Binary-Classification-Model-Comparison

This repository presents an extensive comparison of binary classification machine learning models applied to a diabetes dataset. The project aims to assess the performance of various algorithms in predicting the onset of diabetes based on a range of medical and lifestyle factors. Leveraging Python and popular machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and NumPy, the code loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing sets, and initializes several classifiers including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes. Each model undergoes training, evaluation, and calculation of accuracy scores. Moreover, classification reports and confusion matrices are generated to provide deeper insights into the models' performance. The project also includes visualizations of accuracy scores and ROC curves, facilitating comparison and selection of the most suitable model for diabetes prediction.
